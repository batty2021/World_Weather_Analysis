# Purpose :
   Jack and Beta testers loves to use PlanMytrip app.Then, I had the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester chose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.If you need further clarification feel free to refer the Vacation_search and Vacation_Itinerary folder .
